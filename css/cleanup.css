/* write your override styles here... it says that I'm overriding the paint.css file and that I need to have at least 300 bytes worth of updates... I wonder how much text I will have to add here to get me another 300 bytes and if that will fool the rspec test.  It's not to achieve a level of pro-sketchiness, but really to see how smart rspec is?  And not only that, but to see if meeting an RSPEC test will create gaps in knowledge moreso than just working towards a goal.  In other words, if I or you (if anyone actually reads this) were on the job and the boss said CLEAN UP that messy site.  Would they really want you to to remove the mess tag by tag, or would it better if you could do it in one swoop?  Not to mention, what a headache it is dealing with tag this and tag that.  Tag as in graffiti tag or tag as in html-tag like you use on a wordpress site for SEO.  Hmmmmmm, I wonder if there's another here now to account for 300 bytes. PS. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, it worked.  Silly RSPEC and that's why machines will never rule the world.*/
